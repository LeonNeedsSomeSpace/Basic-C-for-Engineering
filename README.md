The repository that you find here contains a collection of simple programs in C and C++ that can be useful in engineering applications. 
These programs were created partly using knowledge obtained during my studies as well as self-taught skills. 
Codes featured currently are: 

| File Name                  | Description                           | When it's useful  
|                            |                                       |
| Array Reversal             | Reversing elements in an Array        | Demonstrates array manipulation, can 
|                            |                                       | be useful in data processing tasks
|                            |                                       |
| Calculation for Lift Forces| Calculates aerodynamic forces that    | Can be used as a basis for embedded systems
| as well as Drag Forces     | act on the aircraft                   |
|                            |                                       |    
| Linked Lists Reversable    | Like the name suggests, it implements | This program offers insights into memory 
| Pointers                   | a linked list with the ability to     | management as well as pointer operation
|                            | reverse pointers                      | and can be used by machines to carry out                                 
|                            |                                       | tasks

| Temperature Converter      | Converts Temperature between Celsius, | Useful in engineering applications, since 
| (Celsius, Fahrenheit,      | Fahrenheit and Kelvin                 | a lot of fields use Kelvin instead of 
|  Kelvin)                   |                                       | Fahrenheit or Celsius
