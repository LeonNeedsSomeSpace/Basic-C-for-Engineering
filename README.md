The repository that you find here contains a collection of simple programs in C and C++ that can be useful in engineering applications. 
These programs were created partly using knowledge obtained during my studies as well as self-taught skills. 
Codes featured currently are:

        Array Reversal                 |        Reversing elements in an Array            |       Demonstrates array manipulation, can be useful in data processing tasks
        
        

File: Array Reversal             
Description: Reversing elements in an Array        
Why it is useful: Demonstrates array manipulation, can be useful in data processing tasks

File: Calculation for Lift Forces as well as Drag Forces                       
Description: Calculates aerodynamic forces that act on the aircraft    
WHy it is useful: Can be used as a basis for embedded systems

File: Linked Lists Reversable Pointers    
Description: Like the name suggests, it implements a linked list with the ability to reverse pointers
WHy it is useful: This program offers insights into memory management and pointer operation and can be used by machines to carry out tasks
                   
File: Temperature Converter (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin)      Converts Temperature between Celsius,  Useful in engineering applications, since 
Description: Converts Temperature between Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin
Why it is useful: Useful in engineering applications, since a lot of fields use Kelvin instead of Fahrenheit or Celsius
